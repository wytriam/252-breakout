pseudo-code: 
print out a line of 0's on current line
update current Line variable
	add 40 to current line (pull from memory into a, use ADD command, STA into current line address)
	check to see if overflow bit (c for carry) is set or not set
	if it is set, add 1 to current line + 1 (that'll be the 2nd byte of current line)
increment x
check to see if x is less than 25
